Command Line Program

This was initially made as a part of a programming project for my Computer Systems Class, but will have additional features implemented.

The original program specification can be found at this link: http://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/cs201.02_s16/assignments/proj4.pdf

to run the program, just run the makefile which will create an executable named command_line, just run as ./command_line
